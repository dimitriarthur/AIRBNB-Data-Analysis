# Why Analyzing the Data?

Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences since 2008. NYC is the most populous city in the United States and also one of the most popular tourism and business place in the world. The data contains listing activity and metrics.

The main objective for the analysis is to understand how different aspects influence the price, such as the location, reviews, and what makes a host more or less popular. Also we want to recommend a reasonable price for its users, in case those users are going to list proprieties to be rented at their platform. All of this could help providing a better user experience for a wide range of customer groups.

In this project we explored some of the common features for each of the listings and learnt what makes a listing have a higher price or not. Also we applied some machine learning techniques in order to predict the price based on those features. The results, in terms of R^2 score, showed that the GBT Regressor model has a slight advantage over Random Forest Regressor. Also, we cans also check that the results using the text feature are a bit better than both GBT and RF without this feature.
